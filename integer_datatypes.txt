In Fortran, 
you can change the range of a constant by using the underscore('_').
According Modern Fortran Explained:
"To be sure that the range will be adequate on any computer requires the specification of
the kind of integer by giving a value for the kind type parameter. This is best done through a
named integer constant. For example, if the range âˆ’999 999 to 999 999 is desired, k6 may
be established as a constant with an appropriate value by the fortran statement-
'integer, parameter :: k6 = selected_int_kind(6)'
and used in constants thus:
'-123456_k6'
'+1_k6'
'2_k6'
"

'selected_int_kind()' is an inquiry function call, and it returns a kind parameter value that 
yields the range -999999 to 999999 with the least margin.

Also, if on a given proceessor, if the kind value is 3, the first constant can be written as:

'-123456_3'
