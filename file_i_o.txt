File I/O in Fortran works via "unit numbers"

Unit nos.for files are issued by using the OPEN keyword

I/O is done using WRITE(similar to PRINT) and READ

WRITE (<unit_num>,<fmt>) vars

READ(<unit_num>,<fmt>) vars

Unit nos. are released using the CLOSE keyword

unit_num=5, is the deafult value for reading in from the command line

unit_num=6, is the default value for printing the output on a screen

HENCE, DO NOT USE UNIT NUMBERS 5 & 6 FOR INDEXING.
